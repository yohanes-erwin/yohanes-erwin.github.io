    **Part 2 GPIO Write LED**

    STM32F103 GPIO
    ===========================
    STM32F103 GPIO are generic pins that can be configured as input or output.
    In this tutorial, I will explain how to use STM32F103 GPIO for controlling an LED on/off.
    STM32F103 GPIO can be configured in 4 different modes (input mode, output mode, analog input mode, and alternate function mode).
    For controlling an LED on/off, we need to configure a GPIO pin in output mode.

    GPIO Output Mode
    ===========================
    There are 2 output modes for GPIO, output open drain and output push-pull.
    The logic voltage of STM32F103 GPIO is 3.3V, so the pin output voltage is 3.3V.
    This is the characteristic of a GPIO pin when it is configured in output mode:
    * The output driver is enabled.
    * In open drain mode, a “0” in the output data register activates the N-MOS while a “1” in the output data register leaves the port in Hi-Z. (the P-MOS is never activated in open drain mode).
    * In push-pull mode, a “0” in the output data register activates the N-MOS while a “1” in the output data register activates the P-MOS.
    * The schmitt trigger input is activated.
    * The weak pull-up and pull-down resistors are disabled.
    * The data present on the GPIO pin is sampled into the input data register every APB2 clock cycle.
    * A read access to the input data register gets the GPIO state in open drain mode.
    * A read access to the output data register gets the last written value in push-pull mode.

    LED Circuit
    ===========================
    This is the LED circuit that I use in this tutorial.
    The LED configuration is active low.
    When the PA0 is low or "0", the LED will turn on.
    When the PA0 is high or "1", the LED will turn off.
    The output mode that I use is output push-pull mode so,
    when I write "0" to the output data register, the N-MOS will turn on,
    therefore the LED will turn on (current can flow from Vdd to Vss through LED and resistor).
    When I write "1" to the output data register, the P-MOS will turn on,
    therefore the LED will turn off (current can’t flow from Vdd to Vdd).

    Example Code
    ===========================
    To configure PA0 in output push-pull mode, we must do this steps:
    * Enable the peripheral clock for GPIOA. GPIOA is connected to APB2 bus.
    * Initialize GPIOA by using GPIO_InitTypeDef struct.
    
    This the code to make an LED blinking, for the project file you can get it from [here](https://github.com/yohanes-erwin/stm32f103-keil/tree/master/led).

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C linenumbers
    #include "stm32f10x.h"
    #include "stm32f10x_rcc.h"
    #include "stm32f10x_gpio.h"

    void delay(unsigned int nCount);
    GPIO_InitTypeDef GPIO_InitStruct;

    int main (void)
    {
        // Enable clock for GPIOA
        RCC_APB2PeriphClockCmd(RCC_APB2Periph_GPIOA, ENABLE);

        // Configure PA0 as push-pull output
        GPIO_InitStruct.GPIO_Pin = GPIO_Pin_0;
        GPIO_InitStruct.GPIO_Speed = GPIO_Speed_2MHz;
        GPIO_InitStruct.GPIO_Mode = GPIO_Mode_Out_PP;
        GPIO_Init(GPIOA, &GPIO_InitStruct);

        while (1)
        {
            /* Toggle LED on PA0 */
            // Reset bit will turn on LED (because the logic is interved)
            GPIO_ResetBits(GPIOA, GPIO_Pin_0);
            delay(1000);
            // Set bit will turn off LED (because the logic is interved)
            GPIO_SetBits(GPIOA, GPIO_Pin_0);
            delay(1000);
        }
    }

    // Delay function
    void delay(unsigned int nCount)
    {
        unsigned int i, j;

        for (i = 0; i < nCount; i++)
            for (j = 0; j < 0x2AFF; j++);
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    It is also possible to use output open drain mode to control the LED.
    The LED circuit is the same.
    When I write "0" to output data register, the N-MOS will turn on,
    therefore the LED will turn on (current can flow from Vdd to Vss through LED and resistor).
    When I write "1" to output data register, PA0 is in Hi-Z (current can’t flow because PA0 is Hi-Z/floating),
    therefore the LED will turn off.
