    **Hands-On IoT: Wi-Fi and Embedded Web Development**

    Introduction
    ===================================================================================
    Rapid advances in IoT technology demand a lot of devices to be connected to the internet.
    To design such devices, we usually need knowledges about microcontrollers and computer network.
    As an example, we often found devices that can be connected to the network and can be configured via web interfaces.
    These devices implement embedded web server. For example, most of network devices usually use embedded web server as the interface for configuration.

    Although there are a lot of books that discuss about microcontrollers or web development, they usually discuss the topics in separate books.
    Rarely, there is a book that discusses both of the topics in one book, i.e. the book that discusses how to create a web interface for a microcontroller.
    Therefore, this book is written to fill that gap.
    The Arduino library is used to program the ESP32, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to build the web interface.
